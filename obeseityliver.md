*Obesity and Liver Disease*
====

Understanding the mechanisms by which obesity drives liver disease is an important topic in laboratory science, medicine, and public health. Conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis are ubiquitous in developed nations. The surge in obesity, and seeming inevitability with which it precedes sickness, has harrowing implications for both the individual and society.

The 2008 twin cycle hypothesis (Taylor & Barnes 2018) is a useful medical model to first summarise the pathogenesis of obesity-associated liver disease. Chronic hypercaloric diet, mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g. genetics and macronutrients), expands subcutaneous adipose tissue (Cuthbertson et al. 2017). Adipocytes remodel up to a threshold of expandability and then release surplus fatty acids into serum. Hyperlipidemia results, in concert with systemic insulin resistance, visceral fat growth and ectopic fat deposition in organs and muscle tissue (Samuel & Shulman 2016). During this process the liver manifests 'selective' insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia fails to suppress gluconeogenesis, while de novo lipogenesis continues, perpetuating further ectopic liver fat (Biddinger et al. 2008).

The syndrome can be divided into related sub-areas for specific study of biochemical mechanisms. These include inflammation, transcription factors, reactive-oxygen species (ROS) and anabolic versus catabolic signalling pathways. Anabolic and catabolic signalling can potentially integrate other areas into a unified model that offers novel therapeutic approaches.

INFLAMMATION
====
The obese state is associated with systemic inflammation across tissues (Ellulu et al. 2017; Rodríguez-Hernández et al. 2014). When this causes cellular damage it exacerbates disease processes and promotes self-reinforcing obesogenic cycles. Inflammatory cytokines are the primary mechanism of inflammatory signalling, particularly tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Together with other factors and interleukins (e.g. IL-1β) inflammation from hepatic stress culminates in liver disease (Mirea et al. 2018; Koyama & Brenner, 2017).

Early research revealed that cell death of ballooning hepatocytes was required for progression from NAFLD to NASH (Feldstein et al. 2003). Hepatocytes continue to swell until membrane integrity is lost causing cell necrosis (i.e. necroptosis). TNFα increases this immunological form of cell death, provoking further release of inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of action in murine models is through receptor-interacting protein 3, and deficiency prevents NASH progression (Afonso et al. 2015).

Cytokines have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. As a result, knockout models produce mixed results, a notable example being interleukin-17 (IL-17). It promotes fibrosis, via secretion of collagen Type I from activated hepatic stellate cells (Meng et al. 2012), and thus promotes NASH (Rau et al. 2016). However, IL-17 also impairs adipogenesis, deficiency in which improves adipose insulin sensitivity (Zuniga et al. 2010). As such, interpreting the relevance of cytokines in obesity requires system-wide analysis of both tissue type and factor interactions.

Distinguishing inflammation caused by obesity, as opposed to other causes, supports an aetiology of obesity-associated disease. Many inflammatory factors (e.g. infection, drug use, etc.) induce liver disease and yet are only tangentially related to obesity. Three prominent connections are macrophage infiltration, leptin, and metabolic risk factors from hypercaloric Western diets.

Macrophages are phagocytes present in most tissues and, among other immune functions, can release pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adipocyte volume is proportional to macrophage number and in obese populations this contributes meaningfully to cytokine concentration (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003). Leptin, an adipokine originally defined in relation to obesity, is linked with pro-inflammatory signalling and cytokines (Naylor & Petri 2016). It contributes to systemic inflammation through an inverse correlation with Treg cells that would otherwise attenuate immune response (Wagner et al. 2013). Finally, a high fat diet (HFD) alone is insufficient to progress NAFLD to NASH, even when non-metabolic inflammatory factors are present. Rather, progression is conditional on hypercholesterolemia and insulin resistance, two metabolic risk factors common in Western obesity (Liang et al. 2014).

TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
====
The early stages of obesity are marked by increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Several nuclear transcription factors regulate this conversion of excess circulating carbohydrate into lipid.

One important gene is sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), especially the SREBP-1c isoform (Shimomura, Bashmakov & Horton 1999). SREBP-1c is expressed in hepatocytes, primarily regulated by glucose and insulin signalling, and is critical for lipogenesis (Foretz et al. 1999; Chen et al. 2004). Gene knockout reduces hepatic fat deposition in mice despite an obese and insulin resistant state (Yahagi et al. 2002). While essential, SREBP-1c transcription may be downstream to endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Increased folding capacity upregulated hepatocyte molecular chaperones, decreased UPR and steatosis, while improving insulin sensitivity (Kammoun et al. 2009).

Another notable lipogenesis transcription factor is carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). Similar to SREBP-1c, it regulates lipogenic gene expression in the presence of glucose (Dentin et al. 2004). Unlike SREBP-1c, ChREBP functions in the presence of glucose oxidation alone, independent of insulin (Ishii et al. 2004; Iizuka et al. 2004). Inhibiting hepatic ChREBP expression reduces lipogenesis in leptin-deficient mice, improving steatosis and hyperlipidemia (Dentin et al. 2006).

Mechanistically ChREBP increases hepatic periostin expression in NAFLD patients, HFD fed mice, and genetically obese mice. Periostin downregulates activity of proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and thereby promotes hepatic triglyceride accumulation (Lu et al. 2014). This positive relationship between periostin and NAFLD is supported in large cross-sectional overweight or obese human populations (Yang et al. 2016).

REACTIVE-OXYGEN SPECIES
====
Dysregulated concentrations of ROS are implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity. Endogenous ROS levels increase when energy substrate exceeds mitochondrial oxidative capacity (e.g. overfeeding). Mitochondria use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) enzymes to process the excess substrate. NOX enzymes catalyse electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen, and in the process, generate superoxide.

Mitochondrial respiration increases in early obesity, prior to NASH, corroborating a temporal relationship (Koliaki et al. 2015). This process is called mitochondrial adaptation (Sunny, Bril & Cusi 2017). Eventually adaptation fails, and mitochondrial dysfunction follows, leading to proton leakage and deterioration to steatosis.

Of the seven NOX isoforms, NOX4 is abundant in both human and mouse activated hepatic stellate cells. As noted above, the collagenous extracellular matrix secretions of these cells mediate progression to NASH and fibrosis. Oxidative stress caused by NOX4-generated ROS is implicated in initiating this process. Hepatocyte-specific NOX4 induces inflammation, NASH and fibrosis, while inhibition reduces the severity of these conditions (Bettaieb et al. 2015).

NOX4 may also be the only isoform present in adipocytes and is associated with ROS generation therein (Han et al. 2012). In HFD fed mice, adipocyte-specific NOX4 knockout reduced macrophage infiltration and inflammation, while delaying onset of insulin resistance (Den Hartigh et al. 2017). ROS also increase monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels (Furukawa et al. 2004). This chemoattractant increases macrophage infiltration and thus exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines.

A complication in studying ROS is that effects differ based on tissue and concentration. In contrast to hepatocyte or adipocyte NOX4 deficiency, whole body knockout causes obesity and NASH in HFD fed mice (Li et al. 2012). Muscle tissue also has mixed responses (Loh et al. 2009) and an explanation is offered in a review of ROS and insulin sensitivity (Tiganis 2011). Very low or high ROS concentrations have deleterious effects compared with moderate or physiologically optimal ROS concentrations. Such bell-shaped response curves fit the framework of 'hormesis' (Calabrese et al. 2007) and are consistent with stress responses observed in mitochondria (Merry & Ristow 2016). Furthermore, biphasic hormetic relationships extend to the organismal level, being necessary to characterise obesity-associated disease as irregular anabolic and catabolic signalling.

ANABOLIC & CATABOLIC SIGNALLING
====
As isolated fields of study, the above areas contribute many promising links between obesity and liver disease. However, upstream signalling pathways have the potential to integrate many disparate observations into an overarching theory. Two such pathways are mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

The protein kinase, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), is the master regulator of anabolism (i.e. adipogenesis, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and protein synthesis). It is activated in response to high cellular ATP, growth factors (e.g. insulin), glucose, and amino acids (Laplante & Sabatini 2012; Saxton & Sabatini 2017; Wolfson & Sabatini 2017). mTOR is antagonistic to AMPK, which is the master regulator of catabolism in a mutually exclusive relationship. In contrast with synthesis, the mechanism of AMPK is autophagy, meaning recycling of damaged or excess proteins, molecules, and organelles. This cellular clean-up is most active at times of low ATP in the absence of growth factors (Garcia & Shaw 2017).

An hormesis interpretation assumes that obesity-associated disease stems from skewed anabolic and catabolic signalling. Obesogenic diets, being hypercaloric and replete with carbohydrate and protein, disproportionately promote growth through mTOR (Khamzina et al. 2005). This disrupts necessary catabolism, a relationship clearest for mitochondria, with AMPK processes implicated in mitochondrial autophagy (Herzig & Shaw 2018). Other functions are less transparent, as autophagy has distinct roles based on tissue, time, energy status, and disease state. Nevertheless, some researchers do not focus on excessive growth as causing obesity (i.e. mTOR), instead attributing it to insufficient autophagy (Zhang, Sowers & Ren 2018).

The transcription factors mentioned above interact with mTOR and AMPK. Selective hepatic insulin resistance (i.e. concurrent gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis) may be afforded by insulinogenic induction of mTORC1 preceding increased SREBP-1c (Li, Brown & Goldstein 2010). Furthermore, mTORC1 translocates lipin-1 from the nucleus, a cell transcriptional coactivator that binds SREBPs to the nuclear matrix. By rendering lipin-1 inactive, mTORC1 frees SREBP-1c to drive steatosis and hypercholesterolemia (Peterson et al. 2011). AMPK mimetics reduce SREBP-1c, lipogenesis and steatosis in HFD fed mice (Li et al. 2011) and prevent ChREBP transcription in rats (Kawaguchi et al. 2002).

Fructose warrants specific attention given its preferential hepatic metabolism and frequency in the modern diet. Female rats fed fructose developed steatosis with increased hepatic mTORC1 and reduced deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and autophagy (Baena et al. 2015). SIRT1 regulates hepatic lipid droplet autophagy downstream of adipose triglyceride lipase (Sathyanarayan, Mashek & Mashek 2017), and knockout results in severe steatosis (Li et al. 2014). It follows then that the greatest liver fat deposition manifests when fructose solution is provided in combination with a HFD (Baena et al. 2017). However, such effects are only present for chronic fructose supplementation, as acute gavage in fact suppresses mTORC1 in healthy mice (Hu et al. 2018).

AMPK mimetic research has expanded rapidly in light of probable utility in metabolic diseases (Day, Ford & Steinberg 2017). Suppressing mTOR with rapamycin to induce AMPK is the model process. Better tolerated pharmaceutical options include resveratrol and metformin. Application to NAFLD is excellent, showing reduced lipogenesis and steatosis with improved mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation (Smith et al. 2016). Lipogenesis suppression extended to mice with increased hepatic AMPK on a 60% fructose diet, although improved fat oxidation was not observed (Woods et al. 2017).

A criticism of the pharmaceutical approach is that patients may consume AMPK mimetics simultaneously with an obesogenic diet. The long-term health consequences of this evolutionarily alien state are unknown. Therapeutic fasting, and fasting 'mimicking' diets that lack mTORC1 activators, have emerged as non-pharmaceutical alternatives. Animated by the renewed biochemical foundation of mTOR and AMPK, field leaders hypothesise utility in myriad noncommunicable diseases (Longo & Mattson 2014). The framework has since been reviewed for obesity (Davis et al. 2016), circadian regulation of obesity (Zarrinpar, Chaix & Panda 2016), neuroplasticity (Mattson et al. 2018), autoimmune disorders (Choi, Lee & Longo 2017) and cancer (Buono & Longo 2018).

Caloric restriction alone is curative for obesity and metabolic disease. This includes interventions that substitute low energy formula, which is up to 85% carbohydrate and protein, for regular meals (Lean et al. 2018). Accordingly, the benefits of fasting could be attributed merely to caloric restriction imposed by prolonged abstinence from food. To corroborate the mTOR/AMPK theory, outcomes should be observed in normal or hypercaloric feeding windows interrupted by periods of fasting.

In one landmark study, mice were fed an HFD for 8 hours daily, isocaloric with ad libitum HFD fed mice (Hatori et al. 2012). The daily 16 hour fast improved mTOR and AMPK function while protecting mice from obesity and NASH. In a similar study, fasting mice were permitted weekly 2 day ad libitum conditions and fasting was enforced upon obese mice (Chaix et al. 2014). Protective effects remained for life-long fasted mice and obese controls showed rapid weight loss from time of crossover. Differences in metabolic rates could mean daily fasting in mice constitutes longer intervals in humans. Isocaloric twice daily 2 hour HFD feeding windows may address this as an alternate protocol (Martinez-Lopez et al. 2017). Again, protective effects remained, autophagy was activated during fasting, and muscle mass was improved compared to ad libitum HFD mice.
