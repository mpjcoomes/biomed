*The Efficacy of Electroconvulsive Therapy*
================================================================


Intervention via biological means is an effective mechanism by which to treat mental illness. Since the important contribution of Cerletti and Bini (1938; Pallanti, 1999) in the development of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) as a behavioural intervention, a significant amount of research has been produced contributing to the therapy. This essay is an extension of biological theory, which aims to critically evaluate the current framework of ECT intervention. This will be done by exploring and evaluating what modern ECT represents, its mechanisms of intervention, and the disorders it treats. This essay explores the relationship between ECT and mental health in relation to benefits, detriments, controversy, and real world application. Moreover, a significant aspect of this essay is the author's evaluation in regards to the appropriateness and effectiveness of ECT, considering time, cost, potential clients, and the negative impact on ECT from its complex relationship with pharmacotherapy and public stigma.

ECT refers to the direct application of electric current to the head, with the aim of inducing a seizure. The aggressive and seemingly archaic nature of ECT, compounded by negative public (Dowman, Patel, & Rajput, 2005) and expert (Gazdag, Kocsis, Tolna, & Lipcsey, 2005) attitudes, makes it one of the most litigious systems of intervention. After 70 years of development, the unsophisticated and potentially dangerous versions of ECT no longer exist. New systems applying the same principles have replaced them, augmented with modern biological theory to compensate for the negative aspects of the treatment (Pridmore, 2006). Clients undergoing ECT now have the benefit of anaesthesia, unconsciousness, and muscle paralysis through the administration of short-acting barbiturates, succinylcholine, and benzodiazepines, stopping pain and injury from the electricity and convulsions (Impastato, Berg, & Gabriel, 1957; Boylan et al., 2001). The blood is oxygenated prior to treatment, and breathing is assisted afterwards. Electrode placement is tailored specifically to suit each client, and with modern diagnostic technology, all physiological responses can be monitored throughout the procedure (Pridmore, 2006). Despite appearing dangerous, there has only been a single death in 46,770 treatments over 50 years (Kendall, 1977).

How ECT works remains uncertain, but there are a number of hypotheses. One of the most likely is that it mimics the neurotransmitter response used in medication. According to Ishihara and Sasa (1999), it increases serotonin reception by sensitising two subtype 5-HT receptors, thereby increasing signal strength. They also showed that it promotes the release of norepinephrine and dopamine by temporarily inhibiting auto-receptors in specific parts of the brain. Further research suggests that when applied long-term, ECT affects limbic brain regions via increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and its receptor TrkB (Duman & Vaidya, 1998). Delirium also potentially has a role, due to its relationship with psychological disorders. This disorder can negatively affect mental faculties through fever, intoxication, shock, and disturbances of consciousness, manifesting in restlessness, excitement, delusions, and hallucinations. An aspect of delirium is abnormal slow-wave brain activity, which inhibits the regular synaptic maintenance and proper sleep required for normal functioning. It is unclear how long ECT suppresses this abnormal slow-wave activity for, but relapse of delirium occurs within six months (Charlton & Kavanau, 2002).

ECT is effective in the treatment of disorders like depression, catatonia, mania (Charlton & Kavanau, 2002; Abrams, 1997) delirium (Abrams, 1997; Stromgren, 1997), and to some extent, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (Swartz & Shen, 1999). The high calibre of decade old research clearly established ECT as an effective treatment long before ostensibly less invasive therapies appeared. Among this pioneering research were Gangadhar, Kapur, and Kalyanasundaram (1982), whose findings supported ECT as a superior treatment for depression than imipramine, an accepted antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Similarly, ECT outperforms pharmacotherapy for treatment of acute mania, with lithium carbonate being less effective than ECT (Small et al., 1988). Its primary use is disorders where medication has been ineffective, like intractable mania, unresponsive catatonia, and refractory depression accompanied with suicidality.

For ECT, depression, catatonia, and schizophrenia are connected. Psychiatrists used ECT mainly to treat schizophrenia, but now find it more effective with depression and mood regulation, using antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Nonetheless, any client presenting with catatonia from depression, schizophrenic or not, may benefit from ECT (Pridmore, 2006). This treatment of depression is especially relevant when it is not only refractory, but also comorbids with either psychosis or catatonia (Potter & Rudorfer, 1993). The same applies for intractable mania, where similar to depression and catatonia, there is an undeniable health risk to the client if their condition is not treated.

Therein lies the significant point of advantage and disadvantage for the biological perspective, which is especially relevant to ECT; a client is treated for the psychological condition as if it were a disease. Being inherently medical and biological in nature, it targets the body while neglecting the environmental factors that first instigated the mental illness. These factors eventually lead to relapse, which mostly occurs within six months of treatment (Sackeim et al., 2001). Moreover, ECT encourages a passive victim role, where a psychiatrist treats 'patients', indicative of its long history as a treatment reserved for 'insane asylums'. This further reduces their ability to resolve self-destructive variables in their life, and inhibits the emotional catharsis and growth associated with this basic level of self-regulation (Breeding, 2003).

Potential relapse does not discredit ECT, with the long-term efficacy of medication being equally disappointing. Furthermore, treating depression with medication often necessitates lifetime use, leaving some clients to suffer from the side effects of weight gain and sexual dysfunction for the remainder of their lives. When properly informed, clients may prefer the parallel ECT alternative, known as maintenance ECT (M-ECT). The client arrives for monthly treatments, at a frequency decided on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the severity of their condition (Frederiske, Petrides, & Kellner, 2006). It also equals medication in terms of placebo effect. The ritual surrounding ECT gives it significant placebo effects, with clients thinking their doctor has given them the strongest treatment available. Even with placebo controlled, research strongly supports ECT (Gregory & Shawcross, 1985), these findings emphasising the objective, biological, and traditional medical perspective ECT is based on.

A potential negative side effect of ECT is memory loss. However, modern developments in electrode placement from bilateral to unilateral minimise this. Advances in the ECT device itself, moving away from less effective sine waves to brief square waves, further reduces subjective memory loss (Squire & Slater, 1983). This does not take into account that the memory loss associated with ECT may actually be due to the disorder itself. Depression, for example, involves distractibility, slower thought processes, and impaired working memory (Qin et al., 2009). Moreover, the memory loss associated with antidepressant medication itself makes the potential for ECT induced memory loss far more reasonable (Lamping, Spring, & Gelenberg, 1984).

In real world application, mental health specialists use other interventions simultaneously with ECT. Psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and ECT used in conjunction are a powerful tool for treating mental illness. When used with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), currently the most accepted form of psychotherapy, its treatment of depression has excellent long-term efficacy (Fenton, 2006). Likewise with medication, ECT quickly minimises depression and the associated risk of suicide, maintained by prescribing the client a combination nortriptyline and lithium carbonate to prevent relapse (Sackeim et al., 2001). All three systems used in combination represent an integrated system where ECT quickly minimises the suffering of the client, then medication regulates mood while a CBT psychologist helps the clients develop lasting skills for independent self-regulation.

Author Evaluation
=================

My research maintains that ECT is best for critical conditions demanding immediate treatment, considering that other therapies can take weeks or months to show benefit. For example, it provides an alternative to prescribing antidepressants to a client intent on suicide. Short of involuntary commitment, the doctor can never be certain that the client will come back in three weeks to see if the medication was effective. Simply put, ECT is faster (Rudorfer, Henry, & Sackheim, 1997), eliminating this paradigm common to clinical situations.

I'd also highlight that ECT remains the mainstay for severe disorders effecting clients who cannot take medication. This can be due to problems of health, allergy, paradoxical response, the lifelong cost of medication, and pregnancy or breastfeeding obligations. In relation to childbearing, ECT has been successfully applied to reduce postpartum disorders. These inhibit mother-child bonding and potentially compromise the safety of both parties. ECT treats the typically protracted depressive episode much faster, thereby avoiding indirect medication of the infant via breast milk and salvaging the mother-child bonding experience (Reed, Sermin, Appleby, & Faragher, 1999).

I've identified that ECT is almost always considered a second option after medication. I think this is a distorted perception, at least for serious cases. For example, severe catatonia is often treated with antidepressants like imipramine or fluoxetine to no effect, since not all clients respond to medication (Ungvari, Leung, Wong, & Lau, 1994). Then ECT, used as an auxiliary or second round treatment, will alleviate the catatonia where medication failed. Conversely, there are cases where ECT failed to treat the client, and subsequently medication was effective (Smith & Lebegue, 1991). This presents a dynamic relationship between ECT and medication, which the literature does not fully understand. What it does show however, is that simultaneous use is less effective than either treatment alone. Certain medications decrease the length of ECT induced convulsions, while increasing client resistance and threshold, inhibiting the full application of ECT (Greenberg & Pettinati, 1993).

This picture of the literature encourages continued research on these two dominant medical model interventions, ECT versus medication. Especially relevant is the challenge of determining which treatment to use first, rather than the current system of trial and error.

Despite its negative public stereotype, I found that ECT represents the epitome of the Western medical approach and is one of the best responses objective medicine has to subjective psychological conditions. While the negative public stigma of ECT does not reduce its efficacy, it serves as an obstacle to consent, making ECT unsuitable in many situations. This stigma exists to different extents across the globe, but myths about ECT can be so prevalent in certain areas that they ultimately lead to its banning (Smyth, 2006). Despite the social misconceptions, ECT maintains not only treatment efficacy comparable to pharmacotherapy, but also benefits in terms of time span, cost, and client specific variables. It may neglect the social factors that cause psychological disorders, yet so do alternative medical interventions, such as medication. Furthermore, tandem use of a psychotherapeutic intervention, such as CBT, compensates for this and other shortcomings. ECT is not appropriate for all clients, and medication has its place, but the rare usage of ECT, despite the speed at which it alleviates the most severe mental illnesses, suggests that we are not using it to its full potential.
